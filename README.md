This is a repository is collection of my small scale machine learning projects to understand the algorithms and core concepts.
You will find many Machine Learning challenges that I have been tackling, so far. All the datasets were taken from kaggle and UCI datasets.
You will find the details of projects in the notebooks.
I hope that you would enjoy while checking out my other repositories on Deep Learning, Time Series, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision etc.
You may reach me whenever you want to get further information about the projects.
